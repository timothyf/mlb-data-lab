When reading one of these plots, it is important to understand what the axes represent. Horizontal Break (HB) is the movement of the pitch parallel to the ground. In my plots, positive HB represents movement of the pitch in the arm-side direction of the pitcher, while negative HB represented glove-side movement.\n","\n","The vertical axis is Induced Vertical Break (iVB). Induced vertical break is the measurement of a pitches movement perpendicular to the ground due to spin. This means that the movement (or drop) of the pitch due to gravity is not considered. We like to use iVB because it helps capture the movement of the pitch imparted by the pitcher's spin on the baseball. If a pitch has positive iVB, that means that the spin on the ball (back-spin) is causing the ball to counter the effects of gravity (drop less). The opposite can be said about negative iVB, which means that the spin on the baseball (top-spin) causes it to drop more than gravity alone.\n","\n","HB is represented by *pfx_x* and iVB is represented by *pfx_z*\n","\n","I encourage you to check out [Lance Brozdowski's Video Covering Short Form Pitch Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwo3JuwtDAE)\n","\n","Now let's get to the plotting function!"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2182,"status":"ok","timestamp":1724266913508,"user":{"displayName":"Thomas Nestico","userId":"11737412841197753986"},"user_tz":240},"id":"ICi2mZByOyqo","outputId":"0f5fc7ca-6de7-41c3-80e3-ebfd06a79ad0"},"outputs":[],"source":["from matplotlib.ticker import FuncFormatter\n","def break_plot(df: pd.DataFrame, ax: plt.Axes):\n","\n","\n","    # Check if the pitcher throws with the right hand\n","    if df['p_throws'].values[0] == 'R':\n","        sns.scatterplot(ax=ax,\n","                        x=df['pfx_x']*-1,\n","                        y=df['pfx_z'],\n","                        hue=df['pitch_type'],\n","                        palette=dict_colour,\n","                        ec='black',\n","                        alpha=1,\n","                        zorder=2)\n","\n","    # Check if the pitcher throws with the left hand\n","    if df['p_throws'].values[0] == 'L':\n","        sns.scatterplot(ax=ax,\n","                        x=df['pfx_x'],\n","                        y=df['pfx_z'],\n","                        hue=df['pitch_type'],\n","                        palette=dict_colour,\n","                        ec='black',\n","                        alpha=1,\n","                        zorder=2)\n","\n","    # Draw horizontal and vertical lines at y=0 and x=0 respectively\n","    ax.axhline(y=0, color='#808080', alpha=0.5, linestyle='--', zorder=1)\n","    ax.axvline(x=0, color='#808080', alpha=0.5, linestyle='--', zorder=1)\n","\n","    # Set the labels for the x and y axes\n","    ax.set_xlabel('Horizontal Break (in)', fontdict=font_properties_axes)\n","    ax.set_ylabel('Induced Vertical Break (in)', fontdict=font_properties_axes)\n","\n","    # Set the title of the plot\n","    ax.set_title(\"Pitch Breaks\", fontdict=font_properties_titles)\n","\n","    # Remove the legend\n","    ax.get_legend().remove()\n","\n","    # Set the tick positions and labels for the x and y axes\n","    ax.set_xticks(range(-20, 21, 10))\n","    ax.set_xticklabels(range(-20, 21, 10), fontdict=font_properties)\n","    ax.set_yticks(range(-20, 21, 10))\n","    ax.set_yticklabels(range(-20, 21, 10), fontdict=font_properties)\n","\n","    # Set the limits for the x and y axes\n","    ax.set_xlim((-25, 25))\n","    ax.set_ylim((-25, 25))\n","\n","    # Add text annotations based on the pitcher's throwing hand\n","    if df['p_throws'].values[0] == 'R':\n","        ax.text(-24.2, -24.2, s='← Glove Side', fontstyle='italic', ha='left', va='bottom',\n","                bbox=dict(facecolor='white', edgecolor='black'), fontsize=10, zorder=3)\n","        ax.text(24.2, -24.2, s='Arm Side →', fontstyle='italic', ha='right', va='bottom',\n","                bbox=dict(facecolor='white', edgecolor='black'), fontsize=10, zorder=3)\n","\n","    if df['p_throws'].values[0] == 'L':\n","        ax.invert_xaxis()\n","        ax.text(24.2, -24.2, s='← Arm Side', fontstyle='italic', ha='left', va='bottom',\n","                bbox=dict(facecolor='white', edgecolor='black'), fontsize=10, zorder=3)\n","        ax.text(-24.2, -24.2, s='Glove Side →', fontstyle='italic', ha='right', va='bottom',\n","                bbox=dict(facecolor='white', edgecolor='black'), fontsize=10, zorder=3)\n","\n","    # Set the aspect ratio of the plot to be equal\n","    ax.set_aspect('equal', adjustable='box')\n","\n","    # Format the x and y axis tick labels as integers\n","    ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: int(x)))\n","    ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: int(x)))\n","\n","\n","break_plot(df=df,ax=plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6))[1])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"L0NCj7VlOyqp"},"source":["We now have Tarik Skubal's Pitch movement plot!
